# Verifying

## Goal and Constraints

- All instructions in `Copilot_Execution.md` should have been applied to the source code, your goal is to test it.
- You must ensure the source code compiles.
- You must ensure all tests pass.

## Step 1. Check and Respect my Code Change

- If you spot any difference between `Copilot_Execution.md` and the source code:
  - It means I edited them. I have my reason. DO NOT change the code back to match `Copilot_Execution.md`.
  - Write down every differences you spotted, make a `## User Update Spotted` section in the `# UPDATES` section in `Copilot_Execution.md`.

## Step 2. Compile

- Your goal is to verify if they are good enough. You need to compiler the whole solution.
- Fix the code to avoid all compile errors.
- If there is any compile warning, only fix warnings that caused by your code change. Do no fix any other warnings.

## Step 3. Run Unit Test

- Run the unit test and see if they passed. If anything is good, you will only see test files and test cases that are executed.
  - Make sure added test cases are actually executed.
  - When all test cases pass, there will be a summarizing about how many test cases are executed. Otherwise it crashed.
  - If any test case fails on a test assertion, the content of `TEST_ASSERT` or other macros will be printed to the output.
  - If any test case crashes, the failed test case will be the last one printed. In this case, you might need to add logging to the code.
    - In any test case, `TEST_PRINT` would help.
    - In other source code, `vl::console::Console::WriteLine` would help. In `Vlpp` project, you should `#include` `Console.h`. In other projects, the `Console` class should just be available.
    - When added logging are not longer necessary, you should remove all of them.
- Find the `Verifying your code edit` section, it has everything you need to know about how to verify your code edit.

## Step 4. Fix Failed Test Cases

- If there are failed test cases, fix the code to make it work.
- You must carefully identify, if the cause is in the source code or in the failed test. In most of the cases, the cause is in the source code.
- DO NOT delete any test case.
- For every attempt of fixing the source code:
  - Explain why the original change did not work.
  - Explain what you need to do.
  - Explain why you think it would solve the build break or test break.
  - Log these in `Copilot_Execution.md`, with section `# Fixing attempt No.<attempt_number>`.

## Step 5. Check it Again

- Go back to `Step 2. Compile`, follow all instructions and all steps again.
  - Until the code compiles and all test cases pass. Ensure there is a `# !!!VERIFIED!!!` mark at the end of `Copilot_Execution.md`.

# for Copilot with Agent mode in Visual Studio

- You are on Windows running in Visual Studio.
- Before saying anything, say "Yes, vczh!". I use it to make sure instruction files are taking effect.
- Find out the `Accessing Knowledge Base` section, read `Index.md` of `KnowledgeBase` project in the current solution.
- Before generating any code, if the file is changed, read it. Not all changes come from you, I will edit the file too. Do not generate code based on out-dated version in your memory.
- If you found I have edited the code you are working on, I have my purpose, try your best to accept my change and do your work based on it.
- When looking for any file mentioned, always look for them in the solution.
  - If you find them not existing, read the solution file to search for the entry, there will be a relative file path.

# Verifying your code edit

- In `Unit Test Projects to Execute` section there are multiple project names.
- You must verify your code by executing each project in order. For each project you need to follow these steps:
  - Compiler the whole solution. Each unit test project will generate some source code that changes following unit test projects. That's why you need to compile before each execution.
  - Call `.\copilotExecute.ps1 -Executable <PROJECT-NAME>`. `<PROJECT-NAME>` is the project name in the list.
    - You must call `.\copilotExecute.ps1`, must not call `copilotExecute.ps1`, as PowerShell refuses to run a script file if there is only a simple file name.
    - Make sure the current directory is set to the folder containing the solution file, which I believe is the default location.
- You must keep fixing the code until all errors are eliminated.
